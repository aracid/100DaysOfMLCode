# 100 Days Of ML Code

## Day 1 : October 9th 2018
1 Hour

### Introduction into Q Learning
Difference between On Policy and Off Policies.

- Q Learning is Off Policy Method.
- Temporal differences is similar to a moving average.
- Adaptive learning rate - to assist in speed. If Alpha is too high, we may miss the sweet spot, if its too low, then its to slow to train.

### Neural Material Synthesis
Neural Material Synthesis is something that interests me, and as I am currently working on an animated feature that requires synthetic textures, this approach would make sense.

### Alpha go has been revised
  1) Only self play
  2) Predefined features, no hand crafted features.
  3) Change from inception to res-net (Residual)
  4) Combined policy and value network

### Variational Autoencoders
Compress data into a space
AutoEncoder - represent high dimensional data into low dimensional data.
VAE is different because it has 2 terms, mean and standard deviation.

- Learns online.
- Learns directly from the environment.
I didn't quiet follow and will have to re-watch

### Reinforcement Learning
[An introduction to Reinforcement Learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JgvyzIkgxF0)
The network that transforms input frames to output actions is called the policy network.
